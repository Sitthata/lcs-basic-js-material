What's Hiding Amongst the Crowd?

A word is on the loose and now has tried to hide amongst a crowd of tall letters! Help write a function to detect what the word is, knowing the following rules:

- The wanted word is in lowercase.
- The crowd of letters is all in uppercase.
- Note that the word will be spread out amongst the random letters, but their letters remain in the same order.

detectWord("UcUNFYGaFYFYGtNUH") ➞ "cat"
detectWord("bEEFGBuFBRrHgUHlNFYaYr") ➞ "burglar"
detectWord("YFemHUFBbezFBYzFBYLleGBYEFGBMENTment") ➞ "embezzlement"
